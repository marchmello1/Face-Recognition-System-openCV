# Face-Recognition-System-openCv
The face recognition system using OpenCV is a powerful computer vision technology that detects and analyzes human faces in real-time. It leverages OpenCV's algorithms to detect facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and compares them to a pre-existing database of known faces for identification.
